# Portfolio Assignment

## Day One (16th/10/2021)

Create all pages and filled in basic layout of HTML script for each of the pages. Create a CSS stylesheet and linked all pages to it to have cohesive design.

Added a title and main header for each page, as well as a placeholder for a banner picture. Put a placeholder for the navbar which I will introduce once I have my layout figured out and created a basic form for contact page which I will expand on later.
